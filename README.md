# Feed the Need - NGO free distributed & scalable food donation system
Every person feels to feed the hunger, more specifically in difficult times like covid-19 &amp; more happily if they are assured that its been reaching the need.  Having NGO as centralized system of donation is not scalable, reachable &amp; feasible at every place.  Our idea you can relate with distributed system of food donation.  PROVIDER - Individual wants to donate food on specific date of specific quantity.  NEEDY - Person is in need of food during specific date &amp; time. They are not using app, they are just poor who are being noticed by HELPING HAND person/group.  HELPING HAND - would be the one who would be collecting the food from PROVIDER &amp; will provide the food to NEEDY ( helping hand can be public servant like police, muncipalty person etc or some individual/group)  FOOD SPOTS -- Any user can register to create food-spot and handle responsibility for the same. He'll be responsible for food spot management (Food spots can be available for 2-3 hours a day for saving waiting time of everyone)
